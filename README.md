# High-Speed-multiplier-circuit
The repository is a verilog implementation of a 16-bit counter using multi input counters.
The design being followed was from the following paper-
Mehta, M., Parmar, V. and Swartzlander, E., 1991, June. High-speed multiplier design using multi-input counter and compressor circuits. In Proceedings 10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (pp. 43-50). IEEE.

The code was implemented using Xillinx ISE.

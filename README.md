# Verilog-Counter-Circuits
This repository contains Verilog code for multi input counter circuits.The designs were implemented using Xilinx ISE.

The following counters were implemented-

    • 4:3 counter (four_three_counter.v)
    • 5:3 counter (five_three_counter.v)
    • 6:3 counter (six_three_counter.v)
    • 7:3 counter (seven_three_counter.v)
